## Hello!

Who am I?

. . .

Who are you?

-   What is your background?

-   Do you have experience with data analysis?

-   What's your attitude towards statistics?

::: notes
Do this interactively!

Include part on stats anxiety here, maybe Menti

## Organizational Issues

::: incremental
-   *Warning*: The course only lasts until mid-December - but we have to squeeze the content of the full semester in these 8 weeks!

    -   This means, we'll have two sessions per week, Statistics (Input) on Tuesdays and R Programming (Hands-on) on Wednesdays

-   The course will take place online!

-   We will use these textbooks (Open Educational Resources - freely available online):

    -   Statistical Thinking for the 21st Century (https://statsthinking21.github.io/statsthinking21-core-site/index.html)

    -   For the R part: Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis (https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v2/)
:::

## Contents

::: incremental
-   From basic probability to (Generalized) Linear Mixed Models
-   Input (lecture style) with hands-on R sessions
-   Input will be video based that you should watch before the (R) session
-   In addition, you should read a few pages in the text book (OER: Statistical Thinking for the 21st Century, <https://statsthinking21.github.io/>)
-   Project: Independently analyze a dataset
:::

## Project

-   Find a dataset (this can be your own from an internship etc. or open data),

-   preprocess/wrangle it,

-   analyze the data,

-   and write a report!

# Why Statistics?

## Why is it important that YOU know statistics?

::: {.incremental .smaller}
::: columns
::: {.column .smaller width="80%"}
-   You're doing a research master!

    -   Research = Read papers (and understand the analyses), design experiments, analyze data, interpret results...

-   We live in an increasingly data-centric world

    -   Knowing how to wrangle and analyze data is a valuable skill

-   Facts & data literacy matter more than ever!

    -   Fake News, "Lying with stats", Reproducibility Crisis

possibly show empirical cycle or the like to indicate that stats are necessary at almost every step

## What is statistical thinking?

::: incremental
-   "a systematic way of thinking about how we describe the world and **use data make decisions and predictions**, all in the context of the inherent **uncertainty** that exists in the real world." (Poldrack, Preface ST21)

-   "Statistical thinking is a way of **understanding** a complex world by describing it in relatively **simple terms** that nonetheless capture **essential aspects** of its structure or function, and that also provide us some idea of how **uncertain** we are about that knowledge." (Poldrack, Ch1)
:::

::: notes
break down complexity, include uncertainty
:::

## Why is statistical thinking important?

-   data literacy vs. intuition/heuristics/anecdotal evidence

::: notes
example availability heuristic from book (or any other example where intuition is wrong, i.e. vaccinations/covid...)

\--\> test in class? Ask for opinion/intuition, show data
:::

## What can statistics do for us?

-   **Describe** patterns by summarizing/breaking down data

-   **Decide** whether one thing is better than another, given the uncertainty

-   **Predict** how other people would "behave" (generalize to new observations)

::: notes
ask first in class?

describe: not useful to look at every single data point/person, but we need s.th. like tendencies/trends...
:::

## The big ideas

::: incremental
-   **Learning from data**: Update our beliefs

-   **Aggregation**: How to summarize the data to draw meaningful conclusions?

-   **Uncertainty**: Probabilistic evidence

-   **Sampling from the population**: Which people etc. do we select?
:::

::: notes
ask for every point what I could mean w/ it?

uncert: stats = tools for making decisions under uncert, we can never prove anything but provide evidence, there is no 100% certainty for an outcome (cancer)

sampling: how do we represent the population? What is the population? how much data do we need? More is better, but payoff decreases...
:::

## Causality

Correlation does not imply causation... but is a hint!

Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) as the solution?

::: notes
give example! Eat more fat = living longer? Confounders

RCT: exp control and manipulation, removes confounds if done well\
At least some more causal evidence!
:::

## What are data?

-   What do you think are data?

::: {.incremental .smaller}
-   qualitative vs. quantitative

    -   qualitative?

        -   open questions, descriptions... can potentially be coded into categories

    -   quantitative?

        -   numeric, can be averaged etc.
:::

::: notes
Collect: Do you have ideas? What are data you encounter in your lives/work etc? What are differences between these data?
:::

## What are data? (2)

::: {.incremental .smaller}
-   types of numbers (quantitative!)

    -   binary: 0 or 1, TRUE or FALSE (logical)

    -   integers: whole numbers

    -   real numbers: decimals/fractions

-   discrete vs. continuous

    -   discrete?

        -   finite set of particular values

    -   continuous?

        -   real numbers that fall into particular range
:::

::: notes
discrete vs. continuous: question for examples or quiz
:::

## What is a data set?

-   a collection of data

-   usually organized into rows and columns (like an excel spreadsheet)

    -   rows: participants/animals/cells...

    -   columns: **variables**!

        -   each variable contains one type of data/unique measurement

    -   cells = unique observations of variables per participant etc.

## What makes a good measurement?

::: {.incremental .smaller}
-   Discuss!

-   What is being measured?

    -   constructs -\> proxies

        -   need to be well-defined! (Difficult)

    -   measurement error

        -   systematic: e.g. uncalibrated measurement device

        -   random: e.g. variation in reaction times of same participant

-   Do we have a "gold standard" to use when measuring data or to compare the measurement to?
:::

::: notes
Group work/brainstorm:

-   What are problems?

-   Which kind of errors/when is data NOT good

-   how can we minimize error?
:::

## Reliability

Consistency of measurements!

::: {.incremental .smaller}
-   Test-retest reliability

-   Inter-rater reliability

-   Iternal consistency

Relationship with other variables can't be higher than reliability (i.e. relationship with itself)!
:::

## Validity

Are we measuring the construct we're interested in?

::: incremental
-   Face validity: Does it intuitively make sense? First reality check!

-   Construct validity

    -   convergent validity: Related to similar measures, which should measure same construct?

    -   divergent validity: Unrelated to other measures?

-   Predictive validity: Is it predictive of other outcomes?
:::

## Summarizing data

::: {.incremental .smaller}
-   = Throw away data!

    -   allows us to generalize (by categorizing)

    -   and to make predictions

-   Counts, frequencies, percentages, averages
