## Hello!

Who am I?

. . .

Who are you?

-   What is your background?

-   Do you have experience with data analysis?

-   What's your attitude towards statistics?

## Organizational Issues

::: incremental
-   There are two types of sessions: Statistics (Input) and R Programming (Hands-on)

-   We will use these textbooks (Open Educational Resources - freely available online):

    -   Statistical Thinking for the 21st Century (<https://statsthinking21.github.io/statsthinking21-core-site/index.html>)

    -   For the R part: Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis (<https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v2/>)
:::

::: notes
Stats Anxiety: It will be packed, but it will be ok (You can always reach me with questions!)!

For some, e.g. the psychologists, it will be more of a repetition - but you will also learn R.

The input and hands-on sessions will be highly based on these two textbooks. You don't need to read the textbooks, but it will of course help if you either read the chapter before or after the sessions: Repetition is always helpful!

For the hands-on R classes: We will work through the chapters together. You might want to decide to skip the class and work through the chapter on your own, that's fine as well. BUT keep in mind that the Wednesdays are the only synchronous contact points with me and you can also ask questions about the Tuesdays here!\
(Otherwise ask questions on MS Teams!)

Slides might be text heavy --\> so that you can go through the slides afterwards again (but textbook might also be helpful)
:::

## Contents

::: incremental
-   From basic probability to (Generalized) Linear Mixed Models
-   Input (lecture style) with hands-on R sessions
-   Input could be video based that you should watch before the (R) session
-   In addition, you should read a few pages in the text books (OER: Statistical Thinking for the 21st Century, <https://statsthinking21.github.io/>, and possibly Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis, <https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v2/>)
-   Project: Independently analyze a dataset
:::

## Project

-   Find a dataset (this can be your own from an internship etc. or open data),

-   preprocess/wrangle it,

-   analyze the data,

-   and write a short (min. 2-page) report!

    -   with short intro incl. research question and hypothesis, methods (both how the data were acquired and how they are analyzed), results (incl. at least one plot) and a short discussion.

    -   All these parts should be at least half a page long.

# Why Statistics?

## Why is it important that YOU know statistics?

. . .

::: {.incremental .smaller}
::: columns
::: {.column .smaller width="80%"}
-   You're doing a research master!

    -   Research = Read papers (and understand the analyses), design experiments, analyze data, interpret results...

-   We live in an increasingly data-centric world

    -   Knowing how to wrangle and analyze data is a valuable skill

-   Facts & data literacy matter more than ever!

    -   Fake News, "Lying with stats", Reproducibility Crisis

break-out session?

possibly show empirical cycle or the like to indicate that stats are necessary at almost every step
:::

## What is Statistical Thinking?

::: incremental
-   "a systematic way of thinking about how we describe the world and **use data make decisions and predictions**, all in the context of the inherent **uncertainty** that exists in the real world." (Poldrack, Preface ST21)

-   "Statistical thinking is a way of **understanding** a complex world by describing it in relatively **simple terms** that nonetheless capture **essential aspects** of its structure or function, and that also provide us some idea of how **uncertain** we are about that knowledge." (Poldrack, Ch1)
:::

::: notes
break down complexity, include uncertainty
:::

## Why is Statistical Thinking Important?

. . .

::: incremental
-   data literacy vs. intuition/heuristics/anecdotal evidence
-   Covid! How likely is it to get infected? ("I don't know anyone who has it", "I've had it and it's only mild...", "My neighbor got ill from the vaccination")
:::

. . .

[![Base Rate Fallacy](images/BaseRate.jpg){fig-align="center" width="600"}](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/base-rate-fallacy)

::: notes
Write in chat!

example availability heuristic from book (or any other example where intuition is wrong, i.e. vaccinations/covid...)

\--\> test in class? Ask for opinion/intuition, show data
:::

## What can Statistics Do For Us?

-   **Describe** patterns by summarizing/breaking down data

-   **Decide** whether one thing is better than another, given the uncertainty

-   **Predict** how other people would "behave" (generalize to new observations)

::: notes
ask first in class?

describe: not useful to look at every single data point/person, but we need s.th. like tendencies/trends...
:::

## The Big Ideas

::: incremental
-   **Learning from data**: Update our beliefs

-   **Aggregation**: How to summarize the data to draw meaningful conclusions?

-   **Uncertainty**: Probabilistic evidence

-   **Sampling from the population**: Which people etc. do we select?
:::

::: notes
ask for every point what I could mean w/ it?

LfD: gather new knowledge

Agg: Can't look at all ind data points, need to find trends etc. (should not go to far! throwing out data)

uncert: stats = tools for making decisions under uncert, we can never prove anything but provide evidence, there is no 100% certainty for an outcome (cancer)

sampling: how do we represent the population? What is the population? how much data do we need? More is better, but payoff decreases...
:::

## Causality

Correlation does not imply causation... but is a hint!

. . .

Example: Fatty diets = longer lives? \--\> confounding factors?

. . .

Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) as the solution?

::: notes
give example! Eat more fat = living longer? Confounders (richer people, healthier diets, less stress, better health care...)

RCT: exp control and manipulation, removes confounds if done well\
At least some more causal evidence!
:::

## What are Data?

-   What do you think are data?

::: {.incremental .smaller}
-   qualitative vs. quantitative

    -   qualitative?

        -   open questions, descriptions... can potentially be coded into categories

    -   quantitative?

        -   numeric, can be averaged etc.
:::

::: notes
Collect: Do you have ideas? What are data you encounter in your lives/work etc? What are differences between these data?

CHAT
:::

## What are Data? (2)

::: {.incremental .smaller}
-   types of numbers (quantitative!)

    -   binary: 0 or 1, TRUE or FALSE (logical)

    -   integers: whole numbers

    -   real numbers: decimals/fractions

-   discrete vs. continuous

    -   discrete?

        -   finite set of particular values

    -   continuous?

        -   real numbers that fall into particular range
:::

::: notes
discrete vs. continuous: question for examples or quiz

Further classify data examples mentioned in chat
:::

## What is a Data Set?

-   a collection of data

-   usually organized into rows and columns (like an excel spreadsheet)

    -   rows: participants/animals/cells...

    -   columns: **variables**!

        -   each variable contains one type of data/unique measurement

    -   cells = unique observations of variables per participant etc.

![NHANES dataset](images/Dataset.jpg)

::: notes
possibly go through columns and ask for data types?
:::

## What Makes a Good Measurement?

::: {.incremental .smaller}
-   Discuss!

-   What is being measured?

    -   constructs -\> proxies

        -   need to be well-defined! (Difficult)

    -   measurement error

        -   systematic: e.g. uncalibrated measurement device

        -   random: e.g. variation in reaction times of same participant

-   Do we have a "gold standard" to use when measuring data or to compare the measurement to?
:::

::: notes
Group work/brainstorm:

-   What are problems?

-   Which kind of errors/when is data NOT good

-   how can we minimize error?
:::

## Reliability

Consistency of measurements!

::: {.incremental .smaller}
-   Test-retest reliability

-   Inter-rater reliability

-   Internal consistency
:::

. . .

Relationship with other variables can't be higher than reliability (i.e. relationship with itself)!

## Validity

Are we measuring the construct we're interested in?

::: incremental
-   Face validity: Does it intuitively make sense? First reality check!

-   Construct validity

    -   convergent validity: Related to similar measures, which should measure same construct?

    -   divergent validity: Unrelated to other measures?

-   Predictive validity: Is it predictive of other outcomes?
:::

. . .

![Reliability & Validity](images/ReliabilityValidity-1.png){width="460"}

## Summarizing Data

::: {.incremental .smaller}
-   = Throw away data!

    -   allows us to generalize (by categorizing)

    -   and to make predictions

-   Counts, frequencies, percentages, averages
:::
