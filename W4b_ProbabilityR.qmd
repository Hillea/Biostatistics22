## Quiz

1.  Would this line of code run, assuming all data and libraries had been loaded in and the data and column names were spelt correctly?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
ggplot(summarydata, aes(x = sex, fill = sex)) %>%
  geom_bar()
```

# Probability

We already covered **probability** two weeks ago. There I mainly introduced classic probability theory, including conditional probability etc.

Today, we will go more into depth about **probability distributions**.

. . .

A probability distribution is similar to a frequency distribution: The difference is that the **probability distribution** reflects the *theory* and the **frequency distribution** the *observed data*.

**. . .**

**Simulations** can be used to get a probability distribution!\
(E.g. we don't have to conduct an experiment, e.g. toss a coin 100x, but can also simulate it using R)

::: notes
freq dist: How many times did an event occur? (e.g. flipping a coin, getting tails)

prob dist: How many times should it have occured? 50%
:::

## The Uniform Distribution

In an **uniform distribution**, each possible outcome has an equal chance of occurring.

. . .

If we have a hat with 12 paper slips with names, each name has an equal chance (p=.08) of being drawn:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
name <- 1:12
prob <- sample(x = .08333333, size = 12, replace = TRUE)
dat <- tibble(name, prob)
ggplot(dat, aes(name, prob)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,.2), name = "Probability of occurrence") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12),
                     name = "Name in hat",
                     labels = c("Your Name","Amy", "Jaimie","Emily","Helena","Ashley","Wil","Phil","James","Lorna","Maxine","Kirsty")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

\--\> Each outcome has a probability in a distribution!

## The Binomial Distribution

The **binomial** ("two categories") **distribution** is used for *discrete* data where there are *two* possible outcomes (e.g. flipping a coin). It models the number of *successes* being observed (e.g. heads), given the probability of success (0.5 if fair) and the number of observations (flips of a coin, e.g. 10).

. . .

How many heads (successes) should we expect?

We can simulate 10.000 times 10 coin flips and count the number of heads (out of the 10). We can use this distribution to work out the probability of different outcomes, e.g. getting at least 3 heads out of 10 tosses.

```{r}
heads10000 <- replicate(n = 10000, 
                        expr = sample(0:1, 10, TRUE) %>% 
                          sum())
data10000 <- tibble(heads = heads10000) %>%   # convert to a tibble
                group_by(heads) %>%     # group by number of possibilities 
                summarise(n = n(), # count occurances of each possibility,
                          p=n/10000) # & calculate probability (p) of each
ggplot(data10000, aes(x = heads,y = p)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  labs(x = "Number of Heads", 
       y = "Probability of Heads in 10 flips (p)") +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10))
```

## The Normal Distribution

The **normal distribution** is very common in statistics (i.e. in the real world). It reflects the probability of any value occurring for a *continuous* variable, such as height or age.
