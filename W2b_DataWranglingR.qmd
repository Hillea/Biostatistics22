## Data Wrangling?

"Preparation" of the data for analysis: cleaning up variables (outliers, erroneous values, recoding...), changing the structure/format of data frames, merging data sets, calculating new variables, reducing/summarizing variables...

. . .

You will spend a lot more time wrangling the data than analyzing it!

. . .

You could do this manually (e.g. in Excel), but this is tedious, error prone & not reproducible! (+ Datasets can be huge!)

. . .

Fortunately, it is easy to do in R

## Tidyverse

You can do all data wrangling in Base R, i.e. without loading any packages. However, there's a neat collection of packages called tidyverse, which makes data wrangling even easier!

. . .

Be aware, though, that coding in the tidyverse style is very different than in Base R!
